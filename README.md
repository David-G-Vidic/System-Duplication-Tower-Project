# System-Duplication-Tower-Project
Team Project Built for Computer Architecture class

View PDF above for the instructions we were given for this project.


The towers were be donated to [The Knowledge Box](https://theknowledgebox.info/). The towers are being used as duplication stations for the
Knowledge Box content. Which provides "the best of the Internet in English and Spanish" in remote parts of the world without internet access.

**Technologies used in project:** Raspberry Pi, Vi, Knowledge Box software, DOS Commands, Ethernet servers...

**Note on building project:**
  The instructions were not that clear or up to date when it came to DOS commands which is why the project took longer than the estimated 12h. 
  
**Team:** David Vidic (Team Captain), Sam Somefun
